            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <div class ="hobbies">
                <p>In my free time, I try to keep my body and mind engaged. I like to go hiking
                    whenever I can and I weightlift 5 days a week and am training for bodybuilding. 
                    My goal is to compete in a classic physique body building competition at some point. 
                </p>
                <p>I also like to draw and one day plan to buy a tattoo machine. 
                    My goal with drawing is to continue to develop my skill and maybe one day start
                    tattooing my designs!
                </p>
                <p>This year I want to get back into scuba diving as well, I got my Advanced Open Water
                    PADI certification in 2020. That year I dove in the Georgia Aquarium and unfortunately 
                    that was the last I dove since but I plan on changing that!
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not busy, I usually unwind playing some video games with my friends online, 
                    watching some tv shows, listening to podcasts, or sitting out at the beach!  
                </p>
